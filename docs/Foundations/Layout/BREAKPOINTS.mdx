In order to provide responsive designs Ictinus need to be able to identify different screen layouts. In order to do so our UI kit uses a simple specification of breakpoints.

The breakpoints are used internally in various components to make them responsive but the mechanism also is exported for usage in all of our products.

Showing or hiding is based on the defined breakpoints as well. Our idea is based on the mobile-first principle which it shows how it works below.

<SubsectionHeader title="Defined breakpoints" />

<div className="documentation-table">

| Breakpoint | min-width |
| ---------- | --------- |
| des1920    | 1920      |
| des1440    | 1440      |
| des1366    | 1366      |
| des1200    | 1200      |
| tab1024    | 1024      |
| tab970     | 970       |
| tab750     | 750       |
| mob480     | 480       |
| mob320     | 320       |

</div>

## Breakpoints real case scenario
