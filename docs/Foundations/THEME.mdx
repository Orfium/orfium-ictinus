## Introduction

Ictinus has an internal system for storing and using theme parameters such as `colors`, `spacing`, `typography` etc. The goal of this system is to provide consistency to an application and improve user experience by creating familiarity and predictability in navigation and interactions.

## Theme Configuration

The theme consists of `global` and `semantic` (referred as `theme`) configurations, both accessible by the application using the library.

<SubsectionHeader title="Global" variant={'headline04'} />

Global tier includes styles with raw css values that can be used to style elements and components. This tier is the base for all the other tiers (semantic etc) and includes all possible styles that can be used within the library. Checkout the Global Tier section of [Design Tokens](../?path=/docs/foundations-design-tokens-about--overview) for more information.
