<SubsectionHeader title="ðŸ”¨ Usage" />

1. Start by wrapping your App with ictinus `ThemeProvider` component like below

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@orfium/ictinus';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <Router>...</Router>
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

2.  That's it, now you are ready to go.

```js
import { Select, Button } from '@orfium/ictinus';
```

<SubsectionHeader title="âœ¨ Extra" />

<SubsectionHeader title="Theme usage" variant={'headline04'} />

Now you can can have access to the library's theme config by using the hook provided

```
import { useTheme } from '@orfium/ictinus';

const theme = useTheme();
```

<SubsectionHeader title="Theme config and overrides" variant={'headline04'} />

Ictinus is a set of reusable React components that implements Ictinus design language. This tool is used for building applications
that fully adopts the Ictinus design language and use the components out of the box.

<SubsectionHeader
  title="Emotion Project - Merge theme configs from different providers"
  variant={'headline04'}
/>

If you are already using emotion and you have defined a different provider you still have to define Ictinus ThemeProvider as well. You must put the theme config example at the top of the providers and yours afterwards.

Then you must use the below function to create a new theme config for the second provider

```
export const defaultTheme = (ancestorTheme: IctinusTheme) => ({
  ...ancestorTheme,
  ...theme,
});
```

The final outcome will look like this.

```
<IctinusThemeProvider>
  <ThemeProvider theme={defaultTheme}>
    ....
  </ThemeProvider>
</IctinusThemeProvider>
```
