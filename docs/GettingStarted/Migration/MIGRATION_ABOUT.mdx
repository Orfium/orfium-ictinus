We're excited to announce the migration to Version 5 of our Design System! This update brings a host of improvements and changes aimed at enhancing usability, accessibility, and extensibility. Here's everything you need to know:

### Enhanced Control and Accessibility

- Controlled Components by Default: In V5, all components are controlled by default. This marks a significant shift from Version 4, ensuring more predictable and manageable component states.

- Focus on Accessibility: We've taken big strides in accessibility. Now, all our components are fully keyboard-accessible and AA color accessible, aligning with our commitment to inclusivity and universal design. For more information [click here](../?path=/docs/foundations-accessibility--overview).

### Improved Documentation and Extensibility

- Streamlined Documentation: Our documentation now offers a more structured and detailed overview, including component descriptions, usage guidelines (dos and don'ts), and interactive examples.

- Decoupled Components: To improve extensibility, components like List and Menu have been decoupled. You can now easily insert custom elements, making the system more flexible for various needs.

- Library Independence: We've reduced our dependence on third-party libraries like react-router, allowing for more tailored version control and alternative options.

### Simplified Importation

- Root-Level Importing: Deep imports are a thing of the past. You can now import anything from `@orfium/ictinus` directly from the root level, streamlining the process.

### Codemod Automation

To facilitate the migration, we've introduced a codemod script:

```
npx ictinus-migrate-v5 ./src/
```

This tool significantly reduces migration errors, making the transition smoother:

- Before Codemod: TSC returned up to 466 errors.

- After Codemod: Errors reduced dramatically (e.g., only 13 errors in SYNC TRACKER).

### Theme and Styling Changes

- Global Theme Access: Theme-related objects are now globally accessible, with strongly-typed .get() functions for precise value retrieval.

- Migration from Old to New Theme Usage: We've prepared a detailed guide for transitioning theme properties, ensuring you can adapt your existing designs seamlessly.

```
Old: theme.spacing.xl | New: theme.globals.spacing.get('8')
Old: theme.typography.weights.bold | New: theme.globals.typography.fontWeight.get('bold')
```

### Deprecations and New Additions

- Deprecations: Certain components and utilities, like the Chip component and theme.palette, are deprecated.

- New Components: Exciting additions include Box, Tag, Link, DropDownButton, and several others.

### Breaking Changes in Components

- Property Naming Conventions: We've standardized property names for clarity (e.g., loading becomes isLoading).

- Component Renaming and Modifications: Some components have been renamed or restructured for better usability (e.g., Drawer is now Navigation).

### Conclusion

This migration marks a significant step forward in our design system's evolution. We believe these changes will enhance your experience and encourage you to explore the new features and improvements.
