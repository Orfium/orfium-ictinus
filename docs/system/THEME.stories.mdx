# System Theme

Ictinus has an internal system for storing and using parameters such as `spacing`, `colors`, `typography` etc. This system can be accessed by the wrapped app with the use of hook `useTheme()` or by accessing `theme` property from any styled component.

<br />
<br />

### Theme Configuration

The theme configuration is the core of the whole app as we said. This consist of `params` but also `utils` vital for the theme to function. The parameters that we store are shown below.

| Property    | Type                                                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| palette     | [Palette](/?path=/story/system-theme--page#theme-palette)    |
| typography  | [Typography](/?path=/story/guide-typography--page)           |
| spacing     | [Spacing](/?path=/story/system-theme--page#theme-spacing)    |
| elevation   | [Elevation](/?path=/docs/system-theme--page#theme-elevation) |
| colorScheme | string ('light' or 'dark')                                   |
| utils       | [Utility Functions](/story/system-utils--page)               |

<br />
<br />

### Theme Palette

Our palette consist of different colors, and types. Each of these have seven shades and you can read more [here](/?path=/story/guide-colors--page#shades)

| Property  | Type                                                                                     |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| text      | ['primary', 'secondary', 'light'] - [Shades](/?path=/story/guide-colors--page#shades)    |
| flat      | [colors](/?path=/story/guide-colors--page#color-palette), 'neutralBlack', 'neutralWhite' |
| white     | string                                                                                   |
| black     | string                                                                                   |
| primary   | Type - [Shades](/?path=/story/guide-colors--page#shades)                                 |
| secondary | Type - [Shades](/?path=/story/guide-colors--page#shades)                                 |
| success   | Type - [Shades](/?path=/story/guide-colors--page#shades)                                 |
| error     | Type - [Shades](/?path=/story/guide-colors--page#shades)                                 |
| warning   | Type - [Shades](/?path=/story/guide-colors--page#shades)                                 |
| info      | Type - [Shades](/?path=/story/guide-colors--page#shades)                                 |
| light     | Type - [Shades](/?path=/story/guide-colors--page#shades)                                 |

The logic is that the **_color_** represents a specific string often bound by the name provided.
The **_type_** represents a specific functionality UI or UX wise. E.g error type is not a color per se but its a functionality UI/UX that will show the user probably in red what was the error

### Theme Elevation

In the system it is vital to have elevation to several components. For this our design team have made 4 different variations of elevations.
Those elevations can be found in the [Card](/docs/design-system-card--card-with-elevation#card) component where you can define in a card the elevation that you want but you can also use a specific elevation
from our system by reference the number of elevation.

The table below shows the elevation metrics that are used

| Elevation | H-Offset | V-Offset | Blur | Spread | Color                   |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | ---- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| 01        | 0        | 2        | 5    | 0      | rgba(16, 48, 102, 0.07) |
| 02        | 0        | 4        | 8    | 0      | rgba(16, 48, 102, 0.07) |
| 03        | 0        | 8        | 16   | 0      | rgba(16, 48, 102, 0.07) |
| 04        | 0        | 16       | 24   | 0      | rgba(16, 48, 102, 0.07) |

#### Usage

```
box-shadow: ${theme.globals.elevation['02']};
```

<br />

### Theme Spacing

As mentioned in the design spacing [section](/?path=/story/guide-spacing--page) we are using specific metrics of spacings.

These metrics are being translated from **_px_** to **_rem_** in order to be flexible across different screen sizes.

#### Usage

```
const theme = useTheme();
...
css={{ padding: theme.globals.spacing.get('4') }}

```
