## Overview

Typography tokens are used to present content. We define the content that we have in 5 categories

| Category            | Description                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Display** _(WIP)_ | Used for short, text or numerals, mainly on large screens                                                     |
| **Headline**        | Used for short, high-emphasis text and to establish content hierarchy within the page                         |
| **Title**           | Used for short, medium-emphasis text that is smaller than a headline and for text within components           |
| **Label**           | Used for medium emphasis text and potentially longer text strings than a title and for text within components |
| **Body**            | Used for long passages of copy (regular emphasis) and for text within components                              |
