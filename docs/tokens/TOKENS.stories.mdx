# Design Tokens

Design tokens are a way of abstracting visual design attributes such as color, typography, spacing, and other aspects of design, into reusable, platform-independent variables. They are a central source of truth for the design system that defines the visual language of a product or brand.

## Theming with design tokens

We use design tokens to create consistency and coherence in Ictinus design system.

We split our logic in 3 tiers where each of them are reference to each other.

- [Globals](#globals)
- [Theme](#theme-you-can-see-it-as-semantic-for-now)
- [Components](#components)

<br />

#### Globals

We define here everything that we think is a **constant** and it will not change if you need to change theme. Globals can be Spacing, Typography, BorderRadius etc

A good example of this can be spacing where we have it like the below

```
const spacing = {
  '0': {
    value: '0',
    type: 'spacing',
  },
  '1': {
    value: '1',
    type: 'spacing',
  },
  '2': {
    value: '2',
    type: 'spacing',
  },
  ...
}

...
```

Where in our system we will use this as `globals.spacing.1` and will return 1px

#### Theme (you can see it as Semantic for now)

Theme holds attributes that are fetched from globals only in order to create a new attribute that will be changed if a new theme is applied.
The attributes values here can be anything that can be changed in a theme change. We are using semantic as a baseline for now.

A good example of this can be textColor where we create a new attribute to hold all new ref such as `light.primary`

```
const textColor = {
  light: {
    primary: {
      value: '{colors.lightPurple.900}',
      type: 'color',
    },
    secondary: {
      value: '{colors.lightPurple.750}',
      type: 'color',
    },
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

#### Components

Component tokens are holding all the token attributes that each component is using. Also Component holds specific attributes for components like we saw `Theme` did. Those attributes values can be from `Globals` or `Theme` tokens

An example of this can be show below

```
const avatar = {
  color: {
    red: {
      backgroundColor: {
        value: '{sem.palette.accents.red.main}',
        type: 'color',
      },
      foregroundColor: {
        value: '{sem.palette.accents.red.contrast}',
        type: 'color',
        description: 'Used for both icon and initials color in avatar',
      },
    },
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```
