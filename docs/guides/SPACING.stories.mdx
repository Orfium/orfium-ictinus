## Design Spacing

Spaces are used for making all the design components have specific gaps between other elements.
In the design there are specific spaces defined. These spaces are the below:

- 0
- 1
- 2
- 4
- 8
- 12
- 16
- 20
- 24
- 32
- 36
- 40
- 44

All the designs provided **_are_** and **_must be_** using those exact spaces for every component.

In order to handle these spacings inside Ictinus we have named them with specific sizing metric

| Size | Space |
| ---- | ----- |
| 0    | 0     |
| 1    | 1     |
| 2    | 2     |
| 3    | 4     |
| 4    | 8     |
| 5    | 12    |
| 6    | 16    |
| 7    | 20    |
| 8    | 24    |
| 9    | 32    |
| 10   | 36    |
| 11   | 40    |
| 12   | 44    |
