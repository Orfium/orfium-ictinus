## Design Spacing

Spaces are used for making all the design components have specific gaps between other elements.
In the design there are specific spaces defined. These spaces are the below:

- 4
- 8
- 16
- 24
- 32

All the designs provided **_are_** and **_must be_** using those exact spaces for every component.

In order to handle these spacings inside Ictinus we have named them with specific sizing metric

| Size | Space |
| ---- | ----- |
| xsm  | 4     |
| sm   | 8     |
| md   | 16    |
| lg   | 24    |
| xl   | 32    |
