### Theme usage

```
import { useTheme } from '@orfium/ictinus';

const theme = useTheme();
```

### Theme config and overrides

Ictinus is a set of reusable React components that implements Ictinus design language. This tool is used for building applications
that fully adopts the Ictinus design language and use the components out of the box.

### Emotion Project - Merge theme configs from different providers

If you are already using emotion and you have defined a different provider you still have to define Ictinus ThemeProvider as well. You must put the theme config example at the top of the providers and yours afterwards.

Then you must use the below function to create a new theme config for the second provider

```
export const defaultTheme = (ancestorTheme: IctinusTheme) => ({
  ...ancestorTheme,
  ...theme,
});
```

The final outcome will look like this.

```
<IctinusThemeProvider>
  <ThemeProvider theme={defaultTheme}>
    ....
  </ThemeProvider>
</IctinusThemeProvider>
```
