Ictinus is an internal UI kit library that is opinionated. Primary focus is to solve UI duplications and provide a unified and cross product UX, UI and accessibility.

This library will only hold abstractions of the UI components and is not meant to hold and business logic in it. <br />
Separation of these components is based on the atomic design principles that help us split to 5 categories atoms, molecules, organisms, templates and pages.
