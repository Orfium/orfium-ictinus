# COLORS<br/><br/>

### PALETTE

The palette is a collection of colors that has being designed with colors that work harmoniously with each other

### SHADES

All the colors in palette are created with the same principle.

Each color includes seven shades, the base color (shade: 500) and six shades deriving from color 500,
three darker and three lighter.

All new shades are calculated with color percentages (25%, 50%, 75%) on white background for the lighter shades and black background for the darker ones (75%, 50%, 25%).

For example magenta `#d21e75`, and we take 3 darker shades and 3 lighter shades, all with a 25% step.

This way we get the following colors for magenta

```
{
  "50": "#f9e7fa",
  "100": "#f4cff6",
  "150": "#eeb8f2",
  "200": "#e9a0ee",
  "250": "#e389ea",
  "300": "#de71e5",
  "350": "#d859e1",
  "400": "#d342dd",
  "450": "#cd2ad9",
  "500": "#C813D5",
  "550": "#b411bf",
  "600": "#a00faa",
  "650": "#8c0d95",
  "700": "#780b7f",
  "750": "#64096a",
  "800": "#4f0755",
  "850": "#3b053f",
  "900": "#27032a",
  "950": "#130115"
}
```

### COLOR STATES

Each color state must follow some rules for lighten or darken the basic color. Rules are as follows

- filled component with color

  - for shades: 500 - 950 = we are lighten the basic color
  - for shades: 50 - 450 = we are darken the basic color

  based on the above we lighten or darken by these

  - hover : 10%
  - pressed: 20%

- non filled component

  - we are always using lighten
