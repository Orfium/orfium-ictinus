# COLORS<br/><br/>

### PALETTE

The palette is a collection of colors that has being designed with colors that work harmoniously with each other

### SHADES

All the colors in palette are created with the same principle.

Each color includes seven shades, the base color (shade: 400) and six shades deriving from color 400,
three darker and three lighter.

All new shades are calculated with color percentages (25%, 50%, 75%) on white background for the lighter shades and black background for the darker ones (75%, 50%, 25%).

For example magenta `#d21e75`, and we take 3 darker shades and 3 lighter shades, all with a 25% step.

This way we get the following colors for magenta

```
{
  100: "#f3c6dc",
  200: "#e88eba",
  300: "#dd5697",
  400: "#d21e75",
  500: "#9d1657",
  600: "#690f3a",
  700: "#34071d"
}
```

### COLOR PALETTE

The color palette have some text color for each shade either black or white. This text color was picked based on the best accessibility for the end user.

### COLOR STATES

Each color state must follow some rules for lighten or darken the basic color. Rules are as follows

- filled component with color

  - for shades: 500 - 700 = we are lighten the basic color
  - for shades: 100 - 400 = we are darken the basic color

  based on the above we lighten or darken by these

  - hover : 10%
  - pressed: 20%

- non filled component

  - we are always using lighten

  based on the above we lighten or darken by these

  - hover: 60%
  - pressed: 50%
