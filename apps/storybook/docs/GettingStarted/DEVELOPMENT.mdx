## Developing Tools

For developing Ictinus we are using `yalc` and not `npm link`. See more about **_Yalc_** [here](https://github.com/wclr/yalc)

Using `link` will create problems when resolving the correct `node_modules` on the linked project that `yalc` can bypass.

Using the `yalc` tool helps us define a fake registry locally, like a fake `npm`, and add our package to that registry.
This way, you will be able to see exactly the same output of the built tool just like `npm` does, but it will be soft-linked with the local version.

Last step is to define the tool on the application you want and start playing around.

**Hot reload and auto-publishing works out-of-the-box.**

## Step by step

1. In order to develop Ictinus you must have `yalc` installed. Using yarn:

```bash
yarn global add yalc
```

2. Run the script below on Ictinus.

```bash
yarn yalc:push
```

This will create a fake publish on the registry and push the latest changes.

4. Now, run the following on your application, to link the package from the registry.

```bash
yalc add @orfium/ictinus
```

This will copy the current version from the registry and inject the `file:.yalc/@orfium/ictinus` dependency on your `package.json`

Your `package.json` should look like this.

```json
...
devDependencies: {
    ...
    "@orfium/ictinus": "file:.yalc/@orfium/ictinus",
    ...
}
...
```

5. Make sure you have added the following to your `.gitignore` file, to avoid pushing any yalc files to git.

```gitignore
....
#yalc
/.yalc
yalc.lock
....
```

6. Lastly, **(optional)** by running

```bash
yarn yalc:watch
```

on Ictinus, any change you do will automatically reload the linked applications when they are running.

## Appendix

After you are done with your development and want to revert the `yalc` process, you will need to run the following:

On Ictinus:

```bash
yalc installations clean @orfium/ictinus
```

On affected product(s):

```bash
yalc remove @orfium/ictinus
```

Double-check that your package.json now contains the correct version of @orfium/ictinus and not the soft-linked local path.

**Congrats! Now you are ready! &nbsp;ðŸŽ‰**
