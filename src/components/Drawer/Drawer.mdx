## Overview

A panel which slides out from the edge of the screen and displays over the current page the user is in.

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Drawer} />

<Tip>
  You can also use the `DrawerHeader`, `DrawerContent` and `DrawerFooter` components provided by the
  library to build your Drawer content.
</Tip>

## Usage

<UsageGuidelines
  guidelines={[
    'When you need a form or action to be performed while still keeping context of the main task',
    'When you need the same form in multiple places',
    'To view more contextual information and actions on a given item without leaving the page',
  ]}
  policies={[
    'If you need to provide a transient notification that the user does not need to interact with, use a toast instead',
    'If you need to display significant amounts of content, take the user to a different page instead',
    'If you need to feature three levels of information, use an internal page instead',
  ]}
/>

### Sizes

Drawer widths are relative to the viewport (percentage). Suggested percentages: 33%, 50%, 75%, 100% of the screen.

<Tip>Use the size prop to pass any value between 0 - 100</Tip>

<Canvas of={DrawerStories.Sizes} />

### Placement

Drawers can be anchored to the `left`, `right`, `top` and `bottom` of the viewport.

### Background

By default the background of the drawer has a backdrop. If the `isBackgroundActive` prop is provided then the background becomes interactive, in case the user needs e.g. to copy/paste from the background screen.

<Canvas of={DrawerStories.Background} />

### Fixed content

If you are using the `DrawerHeader`, `DrawerContent` and `DrawerFooter` components provided by the library, then by using the `hasFixedLayout` prop you can make the header and footer fixed positioned.

<Tip>
  If you want only the header or the footer fixed, then skip the `DrawerHeader` or `DrawerFooter`
  components by including your header or footer code-block inside the `DrawerContent`
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Drawer component uses an internal context state to handle and share the `hasFixedLayout` and
  `onClose` props. In order to use the context state you can import `useDrawerContext` hook.
</Tip>

<Canvas of={DrawerStories.FixedContent} />
