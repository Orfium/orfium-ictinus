## Overview

A panel which slides out from the edge of the screen and displays over the current page the user is in.

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Drawer} />

<Tip>
  The content prop consists of `header`, `body` and `footer`. These 3 modules are all options and
  also header and footer have a `isFixed` optional prop.
</Tip>

## Usage

<UsageGuidelines
  guidelines={[
    'When you need a form or action to be performed while still keeping context of the main task',
    'When you need the same form in multiple places',
    'To view more contextual information and actions on a given item without leaving the page',
  ]}
  policies={[
    'If you need to provide a transient notification that the user does not need to interact with, use a toast instead',
    'If you need to display significant amounts of content, take the user to a different page instead',
    'If you need to feature three levels of information, use an internal page instead',
  ]}

### Sizes

Drawer widths are relative to the viewport (percentage). Suggested percentages: 33%, 50%, 75%, 100% of the screen.

<Tip>Use the size prop to pass any value between 0 - 100</Tip>

<Canvas of={DrawerStories.Sizes} />

### Placement

Drawers can be anchored to the `left`, `right`, `top` and `bottom` of the viewport.

### Background

By default the background of the drawer has a backdrop. If the `isBackgroundActive` prop is provided then the background becomes interactive, in case the user needs e.g. to copy/paste from the background screen.

### Fixed content

The drawer content consists of `header`, `body` and `footer`. These 3 modules are all options and also have a `isFixed` optional prop.

<Tip>
  In order to create your own custom drawer content with custom styles, you can use only the body
  module and style it accordingly to create a new custom layout.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Inside the drawer a close button is rendered by default if header content is provided. To add your
  own close button based on your custom content layout, either skip the header module entirely or
  use the hasCloseButton prop (with value = false).
</Tip>
