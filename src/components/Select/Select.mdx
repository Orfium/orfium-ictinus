### MultiSelect

A Select component with multiple selected options represented as Chips. <br />

\_. To initiate a MultiSelect, the `multi` prop must be set to `true`
\_. In this variation the props: `leftIcon` and `size` are deprecated (`size` is always set to `md` by default). <br />
\_. Instead of the `selectedOption` prop we now use the `selectedOptions` prop (with type: `SelectOption[]`) .
\_. When in MultiSelect, `onClear` prop refers to the all selected options deletion and `onOptionDelete` prop refers to single option deletion
