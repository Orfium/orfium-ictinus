## Overview

The Box component is a helper component that lets you write these common less-reusable elements
more briefly inline.

One of the most common needs when building web apps is creating layout elements that have
certain layout.

The mentality is that we use all CSS props based on [MDN CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

Only exceptions are margin and padding that use them in acronyms like m and p and direction t|r|b|l ending
with m + t | r | l | b = value

## Props

<ArgTypes of={Box} />

## Usage

<UsageGuidelines
  guidelines={[
    'Box can be containers for all your components',
    'Use only values that comes from the theme config',
  ]}

    `Don't overdo it! We suggest to use it for up to 5 props. If more use styled-components`,
  ]}
