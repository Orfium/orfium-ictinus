## Overview

The Box component is a helper component that lets you write these common less-reusable elements more briefly inline.

One of the most common needs when building web apps is creating layout elements that have certain layout.

The mentality is that we use all CSS props based on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS. Only exceptions are `margin`, `padding` that use them in acronyms like `m` and `p` and direction `t|r|b|l` ending with `m{t|r|l|b}={value}`

## Usage

  guidelines={[
    'Box can be containers for all your components',
    `Don't overdo it! We suggest to use it for up to 5 props. If more use styled-components`,
    'Use only values that comes from the theme config',
  ]}
