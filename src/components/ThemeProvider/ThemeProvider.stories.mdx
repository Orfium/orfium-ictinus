# ThemeProvider

A component that will hold all components as childs. These component is the first one you will use and is responsible to setup the theme.


# Usage

```js
import { ThemeProvider } from '@orfium/ictinus';

<ThemeProvider theme={{ palette: { primary: '#2D2D46' } }}>
  ...
</ThemeProvider>
```

# Props

<Props of={ThemeProvider} />

# Theme with button

This is a demo of how you wrap a component on this provider. Because preview is also automatically wrapped in the provider
some things like dark mode switcher will not work as intended.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Setting up a button example">
    <ThemeProvider theme={{ palette: { primary: '#2D2D46' } }}>
        <Button>Hello world</Button>
      </ThemeProvider>
  </Story>
</Preview>
