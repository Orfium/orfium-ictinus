# COLORS

### PALETTE

All the colors in palette are created with the same principle.

Each color includes seven shades, the base color (color400) and six shades deriving from color400,
three darker and three lighter.

All new shades are calculated with color percentages (25%, 50%, 75%) on white background for the lighter shades and black background for the darker ones (75%, 50%, 25%).

For example magenta `#d21e75`, and we take 3 darker shades and 3 lighter shades, all with a 25% step.

This way we get the following colors for magenta

```
{
  100: "#f3c6dc",
  200: "#e88eba",
  300: "#dd5697",
  400: "#d21e75",
  500: "#9d1657",
  600: "#690f3a",
  700: "#34071d"
}
```
