# COLORS

### PALETTE

All the colors in palette are created with the same principle.

Each colour includes seven shades, the base colour (color400) and six shades deriving from color400,
three darker and three lighter.

All new shades are calculated with colour percentages (25%, 50%, 75%) on white background for the lighter shades and black background for the darker ones (75%, 50%, 25%).

For example magenta `#d21e75`, and we take 3 darker shades and 3 lighter shades, all with a 25% step.

This way we get the following colors for magenta

```
{
  100: "#f3c6dc",
  200: "#e88eba",
  300: "#dd5697",
  400: "#d21e75",
  500: "#9d1657",
  600: "#690f3a",
  700: "#34071d"
}
```

lightGray and darkGray palettes are excluded from the above rule.

The grays start from the darkest one, which is #010101 and get lighter with 8% percentage on each step, except the last one that's pure white.
